# XMTP Network Documentation

Welcome to the XMTP Network smart contracts documentation. This collection provides comprehensive technical documentation for understanding and working with the XMTP decentralized messaging protocol.

## Getting Started

For newcomers to XMTP, we recommend starting with the **[System Architecture](./architecture.md)** document, which provides a high-level overview of how the entire system works, including the dual-chain design, key actors, and economic model.

## Documentation Guide

### Core System Understanding

- **[System Architecture](./architecture.md)** - _Start here_ - Complete system overview, chain architecture, and key concepts
- **[Contracts](./contracts.md)** - Detailed smart contract specifications and interactions
- **[Parameter Flow](./parameter-flow.md)** - Cross-chain parameter synchronization mechanism

### Actor-Specific Guides

- **[Payers](./payers.md)** - How service providers fund and use the network
- **[Node Operators](./node-operators.md)** - Running and managing XMTP network nodes
- **[Payer Reports](./payer-reports.md)** - Economic settlement and fee distribution system

### Implementation Details

- **[Deployment](./deployment.md)** - Contract deployment procedures and configurations
- **[Dependencies](./dependencies.md)** - External dependencies and integration requirements
