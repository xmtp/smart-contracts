# XMTP network documentation

Welcome to the XMTP Network smart contracts documentation. This collection provides comprehensive technical documentation for understanding and working with the XMTP decentralized messaging protocol.

## Getting started

For newcomers to XMTP, we recommend starting with the **[System Architecture](./architecture.md)** document, which provides a high-level overview of how the entire system works, including the dual-chain design, key actors, and economic model.

## Documentation guide

### Core system understanding

- **[System architecture](./architecture.md)**: _Start here_ - Complete system overview, chain architecture, and key concepts
- **[Contracts](./contracts.md)**: Detailed smart contract specifications and interactions
- **[Parameter Registry](./parameter-registry.md)**: Cross-chain parameter synchronization mechanism

### Actor-specific guides

- **[Payers](./payers.md)**: How service providers fund and use the network
- **[Node operators](./node-operators.md)**: Running and managing XMTP network nodes
- **[Payer reports](./payer-reports.md)**: Economic settlement and fee distribution system

### Implementation details

- **[Deployment](./deployment.md)**: Contract deployment procedures and configurations
- **[Dependencies](./dependencies.md)**: External dependencies and integration requirements
- **[Proxies](./proxies.md)**: Proxy, factory, and migration patterns for contract upgrades
